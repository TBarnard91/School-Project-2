# School-Project-2
The second major project for my C++ course was to use a priority queue data structure provided by the professor to create a program that simulates a real world situation. 
Specifically, I wrote a program to simulate the boarding of a plane using several boarding methods so the effeciency of each could be compared.

I was responsible for the makefile, and the Airworthy, Passenged, and SimulationProject files. 
The remaining files were for the priority quese and were provided by the professor.

The TBarnard_Project2.zip includes all the other files except for Project 2 Specifications.docx
